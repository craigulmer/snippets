These are simple dictionaries that let you score terms you're looking 
for. They can be just plain text (one entry per line), or an entry
followed by 1-3. The idea was:

  0 = a non-offensive term (like slave) that may be a sign of trouble
  1 = a term that can go either way
  2 = a term that's definitely a problem

The code doesn't do stemming, so you'll probably want to throw in
plurals.

2025 update: I've removed the vocab list here because I don't want to have
             terms associated with my name. I'm sure you can find something
             awful to put here yourself
